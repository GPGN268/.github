⚠️ You're expected to read the [course syllabus](https://github.com/GPGN268/GPGN268-CORE/blob/main/docs/syllabus-SP2026.md) thoroughly.  
📚 All course material will be pushed to [GPGN268-CORE](https://github.com/GPGN268/GPGN268-CORE).  
✏️ We will use [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@ryansjdu/GPGN268/edit) for collaborative note-taking during class.   
💬 Our main communication channel will be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/GPGN268/discussions). There, you will find a private forum that is only available for your, your instructors, and classmates. That is *your* space for asking questions, discussing with your peers, exchanging resources and keeping up to date on course announcements.  


You will find below a tentative schedule, which will be updated as we move through the material – please monitor this page for the most recent version. You can use the schedule as a hub to help you navigate the course material.
